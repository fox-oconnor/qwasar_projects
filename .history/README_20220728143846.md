# My Cat (Python, DS Preseason Track)


## Task
The task is to recreate the cat command using python script.

## Description
I imported the sys module in python, then used a for loop to iterate over the input arguments, skipping the first argument as it is the python program itself.


## Installation
Run the program from the command line using python.

## Usage
Using the input in the command line given by the user, the program opens each given file, reads the contents and the adds the contents of the file to an output variable. 
Once each of the files have been read and added to the output variable, the program then prints the contents of the output to the terminal.
